/**
 * 60. The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

    say n = 4, you have {1, 2, 3, 4}

    If you were to list out all the permutations you have
    
    1 + (permutations of 2, 3, 4)
    
    2 + (permutations of 1, 3, 4)
    
    3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4)
    
    4 + (permutations of 1, 2, 3)
    
    
    We know how to calculate the number of permutations of n numbers... n! So each of those with permutations of 3 numbers means there are 6 possible permutations. Meaning there would be a total of 24 permutations in this particular one. So if you were to look for the (k = 14) 14th permutation, it would be in the
    
    3 + (permutations of 1, 2, 4) subset.
